## What is Peacekeeper? 

Peacekeeper is a robust system designed to detect scenes of violence and suspicious activities in real time through cameras with the help of Artificial Intelligence models.
It works through a server with an algorithm designed to detect scenes of violence, suspicious activities and monitored through a web panel.

## Images system analysis (Server)

Peacekeeper can detect scenes of violence and sospicius activities thanks by Pytorch and IA Models that can analyze images.<br>For maximun perfomance, the server is made in C++.

## Monitor Panel (Web)

Peacekeeper has a dashboard to monitor all suspicious activities and scenes of violence that have been captured by cameras. Made with Svelvekit.
